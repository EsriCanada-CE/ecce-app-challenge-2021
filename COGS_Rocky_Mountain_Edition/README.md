## Mission Statement

Immigration occurs for a myriad of reasons, escaping persecution and war, seeking better economic conditions or simply because of a need for a fresh start. While getting to their destination to make a new life can be a challenge, securing a prosperous future can be even more difficult due to  inequalities which exist between immigrants and their native-born counterparts. For example, immigrants may not be proficient in their adopted country’s language, which correlates to the amount of wealth they will acquire over their lifetime while living in their new country (Painter and Qian 2016). Additionally, because more weight is given to a Western education, there are fewer suitable employment opportunities for the educated expatriate (Painter and Qian 2016). A lower level of english proficiency coupled with an  “inadequate” education result in immigrants earning a lower income than their domestic counterparts (Yaya 2016). Consequently, the effects of employment exclusion and income inequality will result in an aging immigrant prevented from building an adequate pension to retire with in their old age (Curtis and Lightman 2017). Although there are opportunities for newcomers to make a better life in their new country, the challenges they face put them on an unequal footing relative to their native-born peers.

While inequalities are present between immigrants and native-born citizens, successful integration into the host society has been shown to largely close the wealth gap. As previously mentioned, increased proficiency in the immigrant country’s language correlates with increased wealth (Painter and Qian 2016). Moreover, naturalized citizens have a significantly larger income relative to  those with permanent residency or non-permanent resident status, and in some cases, even over the local population (Painter and Qian 2016). Further, closing the wealth gap  increases happiness and smooths integration into the local population as a community (Hatton and Leigh 2011; Kogan et al. 2018). It is important to provide services and resources to immigrants in order for them to successfully integrate and therefore thrive in their new home.

Our application, NooRooTs seeks to decrease the inequalities which exist between immigrants and locals by providing an easy to use, language independent source of information for immigrants who are undergoing naturalization. In doing so, we hope to contribute to the United Nations’ goal of “[reducing] inequality within and among countries” (United Nations [accessed 2021]). NooRooTs is designed to connect newly arrived Canadians to the services they need to effectively adjust to living in their adopted country. Recognizing that English is a barrier for many immigrants, users can select localization to any one of 38 languages supported by Esri which are listed below. A design philosophy emphasizing an intuitive and easy to navigate UI also lead to minimal text being displayed. Users can locate immigrant-related services, such as English-language lessons, consulates, and immigration services and receive detailed step by step directions, all with a few clicks. Our application currently covers only British Columbia due to resource constraints during development. Expanding our coverage to all of Canada would certainly be the logical next step. With this app, we hope that new Canadians can find the services they need to thrive in their new home and in the process, help reduce the inequalities that currently exist between immigrants and native-born Canadians.


## User Guide

A map of BC is presented with locations of interest to immigrants including consulates, Service Canada Offices, English Language Centres and more. Map opens include opening an overlay map (top right), searching for locations by address or name, zooming in and out of the map, returning to the default extent, and locating the user's current location.

# INCLUSITE

## Mission Statement

### Background
Hello! Bienvenue! In Canada, those are the 2 official greetings in English and French respectively. Around the world there are about 7000 different languages [1] and the 2016 Canadian Census reported the use of around 215 of them [2]. As a bilingual country, Canada strives to offer English and French speaking Canadians goods and services in both languages wherever possible. But this still leaves a lot of Canadians blocked by a language barrier. In the United Nations goals for sustainable development, they specified that certain groups of individuals, such as older persons, persons with disabilities and migrants or refugees are the most vulnerable and have been hit the hardest with the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. Specifically, an intersection of these groups greatly suffer if faced with inequitable access to goods and services through a language barrier. 

### Motivation
We wanted to explore the equity of language access for individuals across Canada and compare it to other social factors. Our hope is that large companies and governmental agencies can use this analysis and results to better adapt their services for as many Canadians as possible. 


## Team Statement
Our goal was to take a unique approach to analyzing inequality among Canadians. We wanted to explore any associations between language usage and a variety of social factors. The hope is that this application will be interesting for the general public to explore the language diversity across the country as well as in their specific area and compare that to other aspects of their social sphere. Additionally, in our Next Steps section we explain further how we hope this application can be used as a starting point for further analysis and action by government agencies and other large corporations.

## App Overview

Our app can be found [|here|]


### Functionalities
The main goal of this app is to allow for meaningful comparison and analysis between the different spoken languages in Canada and the presence of inequitable social factors. To this end, our app incorporates several different maps that show the individual population distributions of various spoken languages and social factors across all of Canada. Then, using toggle features, our app allows you to view the intersection between a specific language and social factor to identify regions of increased vulnerability. For example, you could choose to layer a map of the Spanish-speaking population density against low income to identify areas of intersection between the Spanish-speaking population and regions of low income.

In the menu, the user can see a layer list, where they are able to toggle a list of the different languages and social factors available for comparison. The social factors are shown in varying shades of purple, whereas languages are shown in blue. Both layers have adjusted transparency levels to allow for comparison across social factors and languges. For example, by selecting Mandarin and the housing social factor, the user is able to view a map of the intersection between the Mandarin-speaking population and the relative housing conditions in these areas. Using this comparison method, the user are able to identify patterns in the regions amongst where there is an increased number of Mandarin-speaking citizens living in homes built with varying times of construction. We have the following layers available for analysis:

* Social Factors
  * Median income
  * Duration of commute to work 
  *   Private dwelling construction time period
* Languages
  *   English only 
  *   French only
  *   English and French 
  *   Neither English nor French 
  *   Mandarin 
  *   Cantonese
  *   Punjabi

Clicking on the legend, the user is able to interpret the colours of the map and the meanings of each different colour region. This allows them to see the areas of Canada where there is more overlap between different factors, such as the Mandarin-speaking population and housing conditions in this example. Using both the toggle features and legend, one is able to compare a large variety of different languages against a large variety of different social factors.

There are also a couple widgets to find out more information about our project, bookmarks for Toronto or Vancouver and a Print option if you wish to save our map!

## Next Steps
Our hope for this project is that large institutions or government agencies can make use of this resource to better understand which areas of Canada are suffering from increased inequality. From this analysis, organizations can decide on where they wish to allocate more resources or social programs to improve the quality of lives of citizens living in that region.

We realize that our analysis is limited and only includes a couple social factors and languages, but our hope is that this lens of inequality can inspire further research in this area and guide decision makers in the right direction. 


## Data Sources
The data used for this app was sourced from the 2016 Canadian Census. The Canadian Census data was chosen for its reliability and reputability, given that the data was collected and published by the Canadian government, a reliable data source. The census data for social factors and languages was found [here] and then joined to the census boundadry file which can be found [here.]

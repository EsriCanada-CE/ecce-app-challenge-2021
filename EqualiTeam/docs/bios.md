**Bright Addae** (left) is a second year PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University studying Geoinformation science. He received his Bachelors in Geography at the University of Ghana and Master of Science in Environmental management from the University of Kiel (Germany). Brightâ€™s current doctoral research focuses on using new geospatial techniques such as spherical GIS to model urban land-use change. In his spare time, Bright enjoys drawing, cooking, watching sports and photography.

**Alex Smith** (center) is a PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University in the Department of Geography. He received his Bachelor of Environmental Studies and a Master of Science in Geography from the University of Waterloo in 2015 and 2017, respectively. His research focuses on agent-based modelling of complex geospatial systems and developing map comparison techniques, both in three spatial dimensions (3D) over time. As 3D data becomes more prolific, there will be an increased need for these techniques in order to fully evaluate and compare models and data. During his free time, Alex enjoys hiking, climbing, and playing ultimate frisbee.

**Kendra Munn** (right) is a graduate student in her second year of pursuing a master's degree in Geographic Information Systems and Science at Simon Fraser University, where she previously graduated with a bachelor's in Environmental Science, Applied Biology and certificates in Spatial Information Systems and Co-operative Education. Her research interests lie in researching novel approaches to spatial analysis and modeling methods in 3D, particularly in analyzing the urban environment. She hopes to find a career working with geographic information systems to help find solutions to current environmentally focused or urban planning based issues.

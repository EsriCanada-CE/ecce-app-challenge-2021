# H.O.U.S.E. App by Team GeoJEM

The Housing Open, User-friendly, Search Engine is designed to meet goal 10 of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Sustainable Development Goals: Reduce inequality within and among countries.

## Mission Statement

To connect and support vulnerable communities with the power to access stable housing, and keep housing proprietors accountable. This will build the foundation to establish economic prosperity for all.

Our mantra: **We cannot succeed individually unless everyone succeeds together.**

## Goals

H.O.U.S.E. addresses the following **U.N. Goals** *(to be achieved by 2030):*

* 10.1 -- Progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average.
  * **By:** keeping housing proprietors accountable in maintaining securing housing for their tenants which is a basic fundamental right for developing economic growth and prosperity.
* 10.2 -- Empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status.
  * **By:** including feedback from all willing members of the Toronto community on their experience with previous rentals, with access for contributions and viewing open to all.
* 10.6 -- Ensure enhanced representation and voice for developing countries in decision-making in global international economic and financial institutions in order to deliver more effective, credible, accountable and legitimate institutions.
  * **By:** Leading through example. Although Canada classifies as a developed economy (according to the UN World Economic Situation and Prospects), having tools that ensure enhanced representation of voice to deliver more credible and accountable institutions is vital for developing countries to model.<sup>1

In alignment with the U.N. goal of reducing inequality, these self-ascribed goals are met by H.O.U.S.E.:

* Provide housing resources including apartment registrations and building evaluations with the RentSafeTO program for the City of Toronto in a central location.
* Provide drop-in centres and rent bank locations available on an actionable, visual platform.
* Keep housing proprietors accountable for maintaining stable housing.
* Incorporate community feedback to empower Toronto citizens to share their knowledge.

## Background: Housing Inequity and RentSafeTO

Housing inequity affects vulnerable populations including people of colour overall, Indigenous and racialized women, immigrants, and the elderly more dis-proportionally than the rest of the community.<sup>2</sup> With 9.4 million Canadians living in poor quality housing, the issue could not be more pertinent to address in improving equity within this area.<sup>3

As Toronto is in the midst of a housing crisis with one of the top 10 most expensive markets in the world, it is important to focus on this city and what can be done to address these inequities.<sup>4</sup> One of the programs that can help tackle this issue, is the RentSafeTO program which keeps housing proprietors accountable by ensuring they follow building standards outlined within Toronto's municipal bylaws. This program includes audits and enforcement for clean, safe, and secure homes.<sup>5

## Benefits of H.O.U.S.E. "Open User-Friendly Search Engine" 

The H.O.U.S.E. app is:
* Appealing --  it provides a fast, simple, and elegant user  interface that integrates community feedback via the H.O.U.S.E. Participation Platform.
* Interesting --  it produces actionable data by providing a graphical user interface and platform for the community to have their voices heard. H.O.U.S.E. also keeps housing proprietors accountable by facilitating transparency among community members.
* Useful --  it allows easy navigation to housing resources, access to building evaluation scores and rental histories, and allows community members to provide public information about their rental experiences. The H.O.U.S.E. app is available on all internet browsers and mobile devices.
* Accessible -- we have taken public information that was not easily available from the City of Toronto, Open Data portal, and created a tool that has made all of this valuable information easy to visualize.

## H.O.U.S.E. App Description
### H.O.U.S.E. Participation Platform
The _H.O.U.S.E. Participation Platform_ is a collection of survey responses developed through Survey123 and contributes to a rental registry. This could be used to see historical information about properties throughout the city in the absence of a provincial or national registry.

Questions within the survey include selecting the neighbourhood, inputting the address into a map, entering the time occupied, the rent paid based on ranges, dwelling type (i.e. apartment, condomium), the number of rooms, a rating of the experience living there, and an area to include more comments.<sup>6a&b

### Rent Bank Centres
The _Rent Bank Centres_ layer is a point layer showing the location of the centres. The Toronto Rent Bank Program is intended to offer interest-free loans to households facing eviction.<sup>7

### Toronto Drop-In Network (TDIN)
The _Toronto Drop-In Network_ layer is a point layer showing the location of drop-in centres through the city. "Drop-ins provide a welcoming space where participants who are homeless or precariously housed can feel safer and meet their own basic physical, social, personal and mental health needs".<sup>8

### RentSafeTO - Apartment Building Evaluations & Inspections

## Widgets/Tools

### Layer Selection

### Search Engine
The _Search_ widget is linked to the RentSafeTO evaluation and registration layers, offering users the ability to search for a specific building based on the associated address.

### Filters
There are several _Filters_ in this app that allow users to restrict the visible points based on various factors building owner, and range of evaluation scores.

### Statistics

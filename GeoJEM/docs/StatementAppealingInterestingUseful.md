# Benefits of H.O.U.S.E. "Open User-Friendly Search Engine" 

The H.O.U.S.E. app is:
* Appealing --  it provides a fast, simple, and elegant user  interface that integrates community feedback via the H.O.U.S.E. Participation Platform.
* Interesting --  it produces actionable data by providing a graphical user interface and platform for the community to have their voices heard. H.O.U.S.E. also keeps housing proprietors accountable by facilitating transparency among community members.
* Useful --  it allows easy navigation to housing resources, access to building evaluation scores and rental histories, and allows community members to provide public information about their rental experiences. The H.O.U.S.E. app is available on all internet browsers and mobile devices.
* Accessible -- we have taken public information that was not easily available from the City of Toronto, Open Data portal, and created a tool that has made all of this valuable information easy to visualize.

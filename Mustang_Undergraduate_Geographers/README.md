## MISSION STATEMENT
The Sustainable Development Goal 10 is about reduced inequality. Canada is an immigrant country that welcomes hundreds of thousands of new immigrants and refugees every year, where the city of London is also one of the destinations, they will consider landing on (Target 10.7). It may be possible that they feel excluded due to being minorities (Target 10.2). While the governments and volunteers provide packages of fiscal and social support to them, the information is sparse on the internet where the target audiences may not know where to start at all (Target 10.4). We believe that it is necessary to have a one-stop portal for the new settlers to gain information about social support services they might need before and after they land on London.
## London Newcomers Guide (LNG) – App Information
This web app is an information centre open to the public, where it aims to provide a one-stop solution to open data that is readily available on the internet and comes from reliable sources. LNG has a set of interactive maps that provide spatial information for local services that the newcomers they may need. They can use the LNG to find accessible services that are near their residential places, or they can use LNG to locate candidate residential places that have the most accessibility to the services they wish to have. LNG has information about newcomer services, community centres, ethnocultural groups, hospitals, food banks, income supports, schools, and religious organizations where they can access in one single app. LNG also has job-matching services that allow potential employers who are interested in hiring newcomers to provide job information, as well as allowing job finders to leave information to understand what jobs are currently in high demand and sectors that the newcomers are interested in working locally.
## HOW TO USE THE APP
### -USER-
Users can navigate the web app hosted on a website server that is dedicated to provide information to newcomers. First of all, the app has a translate tab on the left edge where users can use the app in their native language. The interactive maps can be zoomed and panned by scrolling or clicking to access local service information. The user can also target their search area by providing original points (such as residential places they have settled in or interested in) and search radius. Once they have located the interested service, they can find navigation options where they can find a suggested travel path with estimated distance and time cost.
For the job information section, potential employers can access the “Employers” tab to provide job information through a survey. Job finders can access the “Job Search” tab to access the job hiring information, provided by the potential employers with the same interactive map interface. They can also take the survey to provide developers with information such as interest sectors and resumes that can facilitate the matching process. The web app also provides links to third-party job-finding websites as well as the local government website for their references.
### -DEVELOPER-
The app can be configured on a web viewable folder hosted on a web server. The web map, app, and survey can be added to the organizational ArcGIS Online account, where it allows the editing and viewing when required.
Survey responses are accessible from the survey folder in the ArcGIS Online content area. 
Data used for the app development are either retrieved from open data source as geospatial data or as a list that is further geocoded on ArcMap with road network data as address locator.

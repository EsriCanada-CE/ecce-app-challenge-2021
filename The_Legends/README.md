## Mission Statement
The outdoors are for everyone. Needing a car to spend time in nature is outdated and wrong. Spending time and being active outdoors is known to reduce the risk of diseases like heart diseases, mental illness, and even cancer. See the UN article on the importance reducing inequalities in access to green space [here](https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/green-spaces-invaluable-resource-delivering-sustainable-urban-health). Unfortunately, systemically disadvantaged people like minority groups do not have the access they need because urban greenspaces are mostly in wealthy neighborhoods, and you need a car to visit hiking trails outside of the city. If you do not have a car, you may also not know about the natural spaces that are available. The Halifax Regional Municipality has many parks and greenspaces to choose from! We want to get you there. Using transit and biking systems already in place, you can use this application to discover new greenspaces and find the best way to get there. 

## Our Goal
The idea behind the [Transit Travelers]() app is to connect you to greenspaces in your area! Don't have a car? No worries! This app is designed to show you several ways to get you where you are going, including transit and bike routes. \

**Here our three goals:**
- **Access** – Improving the ability of people in the HRM to access the outdoor space available to them via public transit or bike.  
- **Knowledge** – increasing knowledge and awareness of green spaces such as parks and hiking trails in the HRM. 
- **Health Equality** – by helping more people get outdoors through access and knowledge of green spaces, this app aims to create equality in health and mental health. Those without a car deserve the opportunity to get active outdoors and earn the mental health benefits of being in nature.

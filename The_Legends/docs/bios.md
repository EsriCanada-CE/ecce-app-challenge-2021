I am passionate about protecting the environment, and how we can re-establish our connection with the natural world. I believe GIS is a fantastic tool for making the outdoors accessible, highlighting inequalities in access to green space, and connecting technology with natural sciences through nature interpretation.<br style="clear:both;" />

                <p class="text-light"><br>There are many ways to reduce inequality. While there has been some positive change, studies show that inequality is growing for 70% of the global population (United Nations, 2020). This can make social and economic development difficult.
                    Since the beginning of the pandemic, it has become obvious that Covid-19 is hitting vulnerable populations the hardest as well increasing discrimination for those same populations (United Nations, 2020). Target 10.7 of the UN’s Sustainable
                    Development Goals is to “facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies” (United Nations, 2020). This is because
                    migration has been shown to contribute positively to development outcomes and some studies suggest that migration could be one of the best ways to significantly reduce global income inequality (Iqbal, 2015). Migrants and their families
                    can benefit from many aspects of movement such as increased income, skills, and capacities (Crawley, 2018).&nbsp;<br><br></p>
                <p class="text-light"><br>Overall migration has been shown to have a positive effect on the receiving country (Devarajan, 2013). Trends suggest that most economies will see an increase since migrants typically perform jobs that permit the economy to be more
                    productive such as childcare and household services (Crawley, 2018). Migration has always been a highly debated political topic as it is a highly visible reflection of global inequalities (Crawley, 2018). An additional issue is
                    that not everyone has the same access to the benefits of migration, and when individuals do migrate, they often find unequal access to rights and social resources in their new countries (Crawley, 2018). This is why we created Welcome Home. This app 
                    consolidates and provides search capabilities for several different services that a newcomer to Canada might need, such as refugee services, community centres and green spaces. The app allows users to search for services through several methods and 
                    provides information about the variety of services available to them. We wanted to create an app that would help people who are new to Canada in order to reduce the stress inherent in migration and to help welcome them to their new home.<br><br></p>

                <p><br>Welcome Home is an app that provides newcomers to Toronto a place to search for a variety of different services that will help them make Canada home. When a user first opens the app the defualt extent of Toronto with the neighbourhoods
                    outlined is shown. Newcomer Settlement Services and Refugee layers are also included by default. There are five other layers that can be explored- Places of Worship, Community Centers, Libraries, Neighbourhood Rankings, and Parks.
                    Each feature can be clicked on to learn more information.</p>
                <p><br>Various widgets have also been included in the app as well. These widgets help the user find what they are searching for with ease. The directions widget helps the user find directions by either car or foot to a desired location. The
                    filter widget has pre-defined terms which can be turned on, for example there is a languages filter for Newcomer Settlement Services. The share widget is to be able to quickly and easily be able to share the app with family and friends.
                    The near me widget will help a user find serivces that are a user defined distance from them. Finally, the query widget helps the user find locations based on keyword searches entered by the user.<br><br></p>
